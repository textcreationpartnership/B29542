            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOtwithstanding the many Accidents that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to the Ruin of this <hi>Play,</hi> it succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded above my Expectations: And I must own my self infinitely oblig'd to the Town, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so favourably, what I at first never design'd for the Stage; it being only the Product of some leisure Hours, which indeed might have been worse employ'd. Had I known the Stage as well as one who undertakes to write for it ought, perhaps I might have perform'd better; but I must look on Things of this nature rather as my Diversion than Employment. If those few Friends I have are not disoblig'd herein, I shall have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Play</hi> it self, it is not my Business either to reckon up, or defend the Faults urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: They who pretend to write by Rule, and at the same time hope to divert the Town, will, I fear, bave but little more than their Labour for their
<pb facs="tcp:199388:3"/> Pains. Peoples Tastes are different in all Ages; and that which was extreamly well received in the last, will be scarce look'd upon in this; for the Muses, as modest and reserv'd as they are, must suit their Habits to the times, or they will be explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; To entertain in private, and divert in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, are two different Talents, and, I believe, both equally difficult.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this, with all its Faults, I am now oblig'd to publish; I must confess I think it so mean, that had it been possible I had disown'd it. But the inquisitiveness of some People was so effectual, as to drag me out by force; and I now stand expos'd to the Fury of the Multitude. One great thing laid to my Charge, in the management of the PLAY, is Prolixity (a Fault I will not here again be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of) I own it a Miscarriage scarce to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and can impute it to nothing but my unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in things of this Nature: But shou'd I ever play the Fool again, it shall be with more Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Moderation.</p>

            <l>YOur Servant, Sirs: I'm comeâ€” Nay, why d'ye wear</l>
            <l>Such Anger in your Eyes? I vow and swear</l>
            <l>T'have put me out; and I am so dismay'd,</l>
            <l>I can't remember what I shou'd have said.</l>
            <l>I fear, do what I can, you all are come,</l>
            <l>Resolv'd upon a Young-Beginners Doom:</l>
            <l>And our poor Friend will find you, to his Cost,</l>
            <l>Like Birds of Prey, watching a dying Host.</l>
            <l>Hard-hearted Men, if I must ask in vain!</l>
            <l>I'm sure I ne'er shall trouble you again.</l>
            <l>I must confess, he is a Fool t'oppose</l>
            <l>One tender Maid 'gainst such a Crowd of Foes;</l>
            <l>The captious Beaux's, and the ill-natur'd Wits;</l>
            <l>The thinking Criticks, and unthinking Cits:</l>
            <l>Those head-strong Judges, 'tis in vain t'emplore 'em;</l>
            <l>With well-arm'd Forhead we'll bear all before 'em.</l>
            <l>Or are my Fears in vain? I'm sure ere while</l>
            <l>You gently did on our Endeavours smile,</l>
            <l>When our old Lords, those Giants of the Stage,</l>
            <l>Did in wild Fury with our Youth engage.</l>
            <l>But <hi>David</hi> can, as they in shame found true,</l>
            <l>Both wear <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, and weild it too.</l>
            <l>Be kind then to his Youth, and, for my sake,</l>
            <l>Don't all th' Advantages you meet with, take:</l>
            <l>'Tis a small Boon I ask; The Poet spare,</l>
            <l>Good tender Sirs, in Kindness to the Play'r.</l>
            <l>Shall I prevail? I hope I shall. Howe'er,</l>
            <l>If you all come resolv'd to be severe,</l>
            <l>If he must die, at least he humbly prays</l>

            </head>
            <l>OF all the Fools, that now infest the Town,</l>
            <l>(As we have many) you will meet with none</l>
            <l>Detested more by all Judicious Men,</l>
            <l>Than the poor Wretch that ventures on the Pen.</l>
            <l>All other Fools you pity, or excuse;</l>
            <l>But him you're bound in Conscience to misuse.</l>
            <l>The Fool of Fortune is your dear Delight;</l>
            <l>Ten thousand Pounds a-year can keep all right.</l>
            <l>The keeping Fool, what bold Tongue dares accuse?</l>
            <l>You may keep any Mistress but a Muse.</l>
            <l>The Fool in Office has your daily Grace,</l>
            <l>Which you pay not to him, but to his Place.</l>
            <l>In short we find (and sure there's something in't)</l>
            <l>All Fools are safe, but the poor Fool in Print.</l>
            <l>We have a scribling Wretch within, I fear</l>
            <l>Whate'er he thinks, will find no better Chear,</l>
            <l>Than all his Predecessors met with here.</l>
            <l>For th'idle Fool took no care to secure</l>
            <l>One single Friend amongst you all, and sure</l>
            <l>A Man in his Condition's past all Cure.</l>
            <l>I blam'd him for it; but he says he knows</l>
            <l>No Favour he can hope for from the Beaux:</l>
            <pb facs="tcp:199388:4"/>
            <l>For in sincerity he does profess,</l>
            <l>He knows not what they are but by their Dress.</l>
            <l>For the Wits Voices he wou'd humbly pray,</l>
            <l>Did not their Talent lie the other way.</l>
            <l>And to the Ladies (to his shame be it said)</l>
            <l>He is so modest, he can't show his Head.</l>
            <l>Then use him roughly, nip him in the Bud,</l>
            <l>He'll grow too sturdy if he's not withstood.</l>
            <l>But hold, methinks, I hear some wisely say,</l>
            <l>'Tis not your Interest sure to damn the Play.</l>
            <l>Well, if y'are kind to this, ere we give o'er,</l>
            <l>You'll find we've better for you in our store.</l>
            <l>He that sets forth a well-appointed Feast,</l>
            <l>Does never at the first produce the best:</l>
            <l>If you will be t'our first Endeavours good,</l>
            <l>Our next Dish shall be more substantial Food.</l>

                     <p>O no, there are an hundred other things, that pass with the same stamp upon 'em; Men are become as fantastical in their Pleasures as their Devotions; we are now a-days grown nice and speculative: Every Man is for abstracting something or other, peculiar to his own Humour, which he varnishes over with the Name of Pleasure, tho' it be in it self ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so uncouth and ridiculous: You shall have some whose chief delight lies in reading a Play, with a good Grace, to my Lady, after Dinner, passing a Complement or two upon her Daughter; or, in their absence, sporting with her Lap-dog, perhaps the more sociable Creature of the two.</p>

                     <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                     <p>These, it may be, are old Fools, sunk beneath the taste of more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Pleasures, and by Age rendred unfit for any thing else.</p>

                     <p>No, Faith, lusty young Fellows, with brawny backs, and full faces, design'd by Nature for nobler ends, but bebauch'd in the very Cradle; their Mothers made Fools of 'em whilst they are young, and they make Fools of themselves ever after.</p>

                     <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                     <p>But don't these Fools consider in the mean time, how unjust they are both to themselves and their Country? Can they lye so securely at home, whilst all the Youth of <hi>Europe</hi> are in Arms, and not be rows'd by the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring War, which roars so loud it almost shakes their Houses?</p>

                     <p>Why, Faith, <hi>Ned,</hi> the grave Men may talk to 'em of such things, but they have more Wit to believe 'em; 'tis for Men of broken and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fortunes, that have nothing to do in this World, to bid up for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:199388:6"/> next; why, an unthinking Canon-bullet may come, and strike our young Hero over the face, and then farewell 1500 a-year.</p>

                     <p>And yet our Fathers, <hi>Bellfont,</hi> who knew the worth of Life as well as we, in foreign Fields, chose rather to spend their days, than sleep in lazy Peace at home, when the English Valour singly cou'd oppose the growing Greatness of our haughty Neighbours, and make 'em bend beneath our stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Virtue.</p>

                     <p>Ay, ay, there have been those days, when a scar or two were thought as necessary to compleat a Man's Physiogmony, as a beard; but that was before patches came in fashion. Our Fathers were rude, ill-bred fellows, <hi>Ned,</hi> of Souls as ill-fashion'd as their Cloaths, that knew not how to put a right value upon Life, because not sweeten'd with those softer Pleasures, which we their famous Off-spring, the bold Adventures of this happier Age, dar'd first discover.</p>

                     <p>Pleasures indeed; but, O how much they've cost us! Our Fame and Virtue given in exchange, may make us curse the Purchase; but hang 'em, let's leave 'em to their own Folly and Repentance: And, prithee, tell me, <hi>Bellfont,</hi> I hope some Men of Sense are still to be found; for if the Town is composed of such as these, I had best back to <hi>Flanders</hi> again; 'twill be more troublesome to me, than Winter-Quarters in an Enemy's Country.</p>

                     <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                     <p>No, Faith, never think of <hi>Flanders,</hi> so long as there is good Wine, good Friends, and handsome Whores to be had; for as for the honest Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as our Friend <hi>Willmot</hi> saith, they are not worth our thoughts.</p>

                     <p>For shame, <hi>Harry,</hi> what, talk of Whores so early in the morning? See if <hi>Fairly</hi> doth not blush at it. Hark you, <hi>Ned,</hi> if you wear those looks always, you'll never rise to any higher service with the Women, than hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Fans, or, perhaps, buckling their Shoes upon occasion. Throw aside that stiff Spanish Gravity, and appear like thy Self, brisk, gay, and witty, as Nature has design'd thee, and do not wrong thy Youth thus.</p>

                     <p>Then I'll call in my Friends to my assistance; but of this we'll discourse more over a Glass of Wine at my Lord <hi>Goodland</hi>'s, and the two young Ladies shall judge of our performances. What think you, <hi>Fairly?</hi> Will you submit yourself to <hi>Marina</hi>'s Judgment?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, if I cou'd but hope she thought as favourably of me, as I do of her; but I hear our English Ladies have thrown off that freedom and openness of humour they have been so celebrated for, and are become too nice and reserved, even to affectation.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
                     <p>And yet that reservedness you seem to condemn in our Ladies, it is no more than necessary. We begin to use more severity towards them than the very <hi>Spaniard;</hi> he by his restraint secures 'em from the worst of Vices, we expose and mis-represent the very best of their Vertues; nay, the noblest of the whole Sex have been sometimes stigmatized in a Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poon for that very Action which deserv'd a Panegyrick.</p>

                     <speaker>Fair.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought those Lampooners Province lay on the other side; does the whole Town afford 'em such thin Diet, that they are forc'd to prey upon Vertue to satisfie their ravenous Appetite?</p>

                     <p>O damn 'em for ill-bred Curs, that love to leave the lawful Scent, and fall soul on forbidden Game; sullen mischievous Beasts, that have nothing of Satyrs in 'em, but the deformity, that by a strange Art of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry, can change the purest of Gold into the basest of Metals, and draw the rankest Poisons out of the wholesomest Herbs.</p>

                     <p>Certainly never had one Man such a variety of Humours, so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite to one another; they say he is Master of a great Estate, and yet he has seldom a peny in his Pocket; a great Lover of Women's Company, and yet so slovenly, that he is sometimes scarce to be endur'd in Men's; this hour so obliging and complaisant, that you wou'd take him for a meer Courtier; the next, so rough and intractable, that there is no dealing with him; and though he pretends to an open intercourse and familiarity with many of the Nobility, yet doth his Acquaintance lye no less amongst the very Scoundrels of the Town.</p>

                     <p>Nay, hold you there, good Cousin, the Country has its Noises too, tho', perhaps, not so loud and frequent; yet I'm sure far more odious. What think you of a Consort of Hounds for a Serenade ev'ry Morning, that raises your good Spouse by Four-a-Clock, who leaves you to nothing but the vain Wishes of a better Bed-fellow: It may be you drop a-sleep again, and dream of one; but scarce has your Imagination shap'd him to Desires, before a a Flock of well dispos'd Geese frightens your fancy'd Lover from your Arms, and secures your Body, that Temple of Chastity, from Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that you have not the opportunity of cuckolding him, tho' it be only in a Dream.</p>

                     <p>True, but it must be one that I cou'd love, and that knew how to deserve me; not your dull Country Ass, that makes no difference betwixt his Wife and Horse; who tho' he has Tongue as big as one of his Calves, can entertain me in Discourse with nothing, but the price of Corn and Hay, or rotten Sheep and lowsie Hogs; that confines me to an old House, the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd labour of some of his Ancestors, who came over forsooth with <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the <hi>Conqueror:</hi> my Company, an old Aunt, or ill-favour'd Sister; or perhaps the Parson after Dinner, who is to tell me the meaning of his last Sermon, and sometime a piece of News six months old, pick'd out of the mouldy Papers he lights his Pipes with. No, no, my Father, Peace rest with him, left me moderately rich; and, or I am flatter'd, I have my share of Beauty; if then any thing above a Justices Clerk, dare be troubled with me here, when I go back again to <hi>VVarwick-shire,</hi> to spend my Time and Money in Pultisses for sore Throats, Plaisters for Scabby Heads, and broken Shins, the Devil shall be wiser than I take him.</p>

                     <p>If he has no more, than I yet perceive, he will not find me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable; but I must know him better first.</p>

                     <p>If he may be believ'd himself, he does indeed; for he had the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to tell me so the very first time he saw me; tho' I fancy there are many other Ladies in Town, can say as much of him: he is one of those that falls in Love with every new Face they meet.</p>

                     <p>He has indeed had the Name of a great Libertine; but you know Wedlock is a Mortifying State, and they say a great cooler of the Blood.</p>

                     <speaker>Clar.</speaker>
                     <p>But I'll mortifie him before, or my Wits shall fail me; for when once I give my Hand, I resign all my Power: Marriage in many respects is like Death, you may make what conditions you please before the Ceremony; but as the Parson finds you, he leaves you, there's no Reprieve to be had.</p>

                     <p>She's grown indeed, but like a blushing Rose, whose opening Bud promis'd a World of Beauty; but being full blown, exceeds our Expectations.</p>

                     <p>That's well said again, adod, you are a meer Courtier, I wou'd not be a young Girl in your way for something. See if she does not blush; a meer puling Wench, she'll ne're have so much Fire in her as her Mother had.</p>

                     <p>So, my mad Neece still, and I faith thou art in the right; but a Pies on't, none but Fools and Mad-men will have any thing to say to you upon that score now, your own Pride and Self-conceit has quite spoil'd your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; a Lover is but a more Genteel Name for an Ass; for twenty pound to a Fidle-string, but you make him such before you have done.</p>

                     <p>No Sir, such odd ways of Courtship have been out of fashion ever since the old Heathen Poets fell asleep; I'd rather have a Cobler for my Bed-fellow, than a Swan, or Satyr: your Worship may be a Bull, if you please, a day times; but at night you must be a Man, or I shall fix a pair of Horns on your Head that will be very uneasie.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, neither my Adventures, or Observations, were so curious, as necessary; I travell'd not to fill my Mouth, but enrich my Understanding; and took more care to know my self exactly, than the Countries I pass'd through.</p>

                     <p>They are indeed; but yet they must give the <hi>English</hi> leave to lead the way: I must confess I saw at <hi>Venice</hi> a perfect Beauty, as such esteem'd, to whom the Nobles su'd, and at whose Feet the Souldier, in the full pride
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:199388:13"/> of all his Glorious Conquests, laid down his useless Arms, unable to defend him against the force of her Commanding Beauty: the Wealthy Merchant too acknowledg'd he had found a Jewel here at home, worth all his <hi>Indies;</hi> and the Scholar invok'd no other Goddess in his Verse, whose tuneful Notes sung nothing but her Praises.</p>

                     <p>No, Madam, I cou'd safely look upon her, and view her in all her Glories; my Heart was gone before, the happy Subject of a far Nobler Conquest; nor wou'd I seek a Mistress out in <hi>Italy,</hi> who had left behind me here in <hi>England,</hi> a Miracle worth all their boasted Saints; a Piece so Fair, so full of Goodness, that the bold Poets daring Fancy cou'd never form a sweeter.</p>

                     <p>O Madam, I'm yet but a beginner, in time you may have me come to this and a great deal more, make Songs upon you shortly; nay, perhaps a Play or two, where you may expect to find your self an Empress at least.</p>

                     <p>Had I the Eloquence of all Men in me, or cou'd in softest numbers court the Vertues, my busie Tongue shou'd dwell upon your Praises, till time it self stood still, and weary Nature sunk down into Eternity; but as I am, I ne'er must hope to find Words equal to my Thoughts, or fit to bear the Message of my Mind.</p>

                     <p>Believe me, Sir, this is not noble in you to play thus with my weakness, and wound my Ears with the smooth Flatteries of your cunning Sex; therefore forgive me if I dare hear no more.</p>

                     <p>O stay one moment; for by just Heav'n I swear, if Heav'n that will strike dumb a perjur'd Tongue, I never did conceive one guilty Thought to wrong your Goodness: Cou'd you but look into my Breast, you there wou'd find Fire so chast, so holy, that <hi>Hymen</hi>'s Lamp can ne'er boast a purer: 'Tis true, your Love as yet I dare not hope for, till by my Services I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd you; yet give me leave to hope I may be happy.</p>

Happy are they that want thee; whose Wills walk free, not fetter'd by a Tyrant, that bears a stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born sway o'er every Passion. Instruct me Love, and sit upon my Tongue, that I may not deny or give too much. Sir, I must hear no more; your Words already have dy'd my Cheeks with Blushes: In them you'll find an Answer, better than what my Tongue can form. You've leave to hope for all that I dare give, or you can ask: I know I've said too much; but do not tax my Weakness.</p>

Tell me, Sir, and tell me truly, What encouragement did you ever give me to build my Faith upon your Love; could I with reason hope to find you true? I'de as soon hope it from a common Strumpet.
